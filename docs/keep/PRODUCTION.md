# Production readiness (what landed vs what still needs hardware)

## Keep 0.1 pilot — release gate

Run on a customer-like FluxVM host with a registered agent template (`node22-agent` / `agent-node`):

```bash
KEEP_E2E_TEMPLATE=node22-agent ./scripts/keep-pilot-gate.sh
# Archives under docs/keep/pilot-runs/<stamp>/{happy,deny}/
```

| Item | How to verify |
|---|---|
| Template required | Missing template → **FAIL** (no soft PASS) |
| Happy + deny | Gate runs twice; deny path shows no unapproved mutate |
| Signed Keep mutations | `ZYVOR_AGENT_KEEP_MODE=1` + trusted signers; startup rejects empty signers. PUT policy needs `X-Keep-Policy-Signature`; POST agent needs `X-Keep-Manifest-Signature` over the exact JSON body. |
| Session / cockpit / restart | Cockpit `software-test`; session recovers after runtime restart |
| OOB approvals | Webhook + approve/deny outside agent chat |
| Console Keep view | `/app/keep/:sessionId` — goal, task, evidence, approval, outcome |
| infra-ops pack | `./scripts/keep-pack-demo.sh infra-ops` |

Latest archived run: [pilot-runs/20260924T182930Z](pilot-runs/20260924T182930Z/)
(**Firecracker** `node22-fc` / `flux-vm`, `guest_worker=ok`). Prior QEMU:
[20260924T172304Z](pilot-runs/20260924T172304Z/),
[20260924T154950Z](pilot-runs/20260924T154950Z/). Bake FC with
[`scripts/keep-bake-fc-rootfs.sh`](../../scripts/keep-bake-fc-rootfs.sh);
pilot gate prefers `node22-fc` when registered.

## Keep 0.1 — live proof (lab release gate)

| Item | How to verify |
|---|---|
| Stub Keep e2e (CI) | `./scripts/keep-e2e.sh` · `.github/workflows/keep.yml` |
| **Live FluxVM Keep proof** | `KEEP_E2E_FLUXVM=1 ./scripts/keep-e2e.sh` or `./scripts/keep-live-lab.sh` (needs `KEEP_E2E_TEMPLATE`) |
| Keep-mode signed policy | `ZYVOR_AGENT_KEEP_MODE=1` + trusted signers; unsigned PUT → 403; unsigned deploy → 403; start refuses empty signers |
| Credential authority | `authorize_resolve` allowlists host/method/path/user; secrets still host-env (not 0.2 unwrap) |
| Confine | `ZYVOR_AGENT_CONFINE=1` / `confinement: strict` on live path |
| Measured profile | `ZYVOR_AGENT_SECURITY_PROFILE=measured` (Keep mode default); cockpit `evidence_class: software-test` |
| Browser live view | `GET /v1/sessions/{id}/browser/view` + `/browser/screenshot` (JPEG via CDP bridge); no input takeover |
| Cockpit / approvals | `GET /keep/cockpit?session=` · out-of-band webhook |

```bash
# CI default — FluxVM stub
./scripts/keep-e2e.sh

# Lab release gate — live FluxVM (template required)
KEEP_E2E_TEMPLATE=node22-agent ./scripts/keep-live-lab.sh
```

To deploy in enforced Keep mode, sign the exact JSON file you send:

```bash
keepctl policy sign agent.json   # uses KEEP_POLICY_SEED; writes agent.json.sig
keepctl create -f agent.json --signature agent.json.sig
```

The signer public key belongs in `ZYVOR_AGENT_POLICY_TRUSTED_SIGNERS` on the
runtime. A policy update still signs the exact YAML sent to PUT. Generic agent
runtime installations can leave `ZYVOR_AGENT_KEEP_MODE` unset. Existing agents
created before enforced mode must be redeployed with a signed manifest before
being treated as policy-verified; signing does not retroactively attest them.

## Landed in this tree (software / control plane)

| Item | How to verify |
|---|---|
| Signed Keep mutations | Keep mode or `ZYVOR_AGENT_POLICY_TRUSTED_SIGNERS`; PUT policy + POST deploy require matching Ed25519 signatures (`X-Keep-Policy-Signature` / `X-Keep-Manifest-Signature`) |
| Export-token gate | `POST /v1/export-tokens`; pack/export need `X-Keep-Export-Token` |
| Firecracker cell | FluxVM Firecracker templates; `cell_backend: firecracker` |
| Full pack metadata | `keepctl pack` → policy, agent pin, vault **names** (no raw secrets) |
| Phone approvals | Webhook `ui.actions` + `channel: out_of_band` |
| Runtime control-plane e2e | `agent-runtime/scripts/e2e-no-fluxvm.sh` |
| Goals / artifacts / packs | `/v1/goals`, `/v1/artifacts`; [`examples/keep-agents/`](../../examples/keep-agents/); [`docs/keep/goals/README.md`](goals/README.md) |

## Still not a TEE claim (Keep 0.2 + hardware)

- Flipping `security.snp_launch_verified` / `tdx_launch_verified` on FluxVM
- User-held unwrap (phone/YubiKey) before vault open
- Real SNP/TDX launch + block-device home (see confidential-agent-vms.md)

Software scaffolding already in tree (still `software-test`):

- Cockpit / console **attestation receipt** (never labels software-test as unread)
- `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/host-recover` — **forbidden** on confidential; measured
  needs dual recover keys (`ZYVOR_AGENT_RECOVER_KEY_A` / `_B`)
- Browser **screenshot** + **screencast** (frames only; no input) — fabricd
  `WS /ws/sessions/{id}/browser/screencast?token=`
- User-held **challenge** API (`keepctl user-held-*`) — complete refused without SNP/TDX;
  fabricd `/api/vault/user-held/*` + `/api/vault/status`
- `scripts/keep-bake-browser-agent.sh` for Chromium template bake

Until then: **the host can still see a measured VM.** That is intentional honesty, not an unfinished checkbox we can close in CI without silicon.
