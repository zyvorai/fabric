# Service Fabric Phase 6

## Shipped (v6+ on main)

BPF **schema 4** is unchanged. FluxVM **program generation 8** covers
connect{4,6} + affinity, map-tier ELFs, and pressure/offload status. Fabric adds
minimal multi-site fencing, a ClusterMesh-like remote identity directory, and
**full mesh datapath lifecycle v2** via remote backends (no Geneve/VXLAN tunnels).

[phase 6](https://github.com/zyvorai/fluxvm/blob/main/docs/service-fabric-phase6.md).

### Multi-site slice (minimal)

- Missing `site_id` / `route_domain` = default single-site domain (backward compatible).
- Anycast VIP advertise uses only owning-domain leases; cross-site leases are ignored.
- Leased apply refuses `advertise=true` without an owning-domain lease.
- Policy fan-out with a set `site_id` targets only matching leased nodes; unresolved
  identities stay fail-closed on the node.

### ClusterMesh-like identity directory (minimal)

Fabric owns a durable remote identity catalog keyed by `(route_domain, identity_id)`:

`RemoteIdentity { identity_id, site_id, route_domain, cidrs[], labels{}, updated_unix_ms }`.

- Sites publish/pull via Fabric REST (`/api/dataplane/remote-identities…`).
- `reconcile` fans CIDRs into FluxVM remote ipcache (`POST /v1/network/ipcache/remote`)
  on target nodes; delete unfans (`DELETE /v1/network/ipcache/remote/{identity}`).
- Policy apply merges directory entries referenced by `allow_identities` /
  `deny_identities` into node ipcache before fan-out. Same-domain resolve helpers
  ignore cross-domain rows; residual gaps stay fail-closed on FluxVM compile.

### Full mesh datapath lifecycle v2 (remote backends)

Fabric owns a durable remote backend catalog keyed by
`(route_domain, service, vip_or_*, address:port)` under
`{storage}/service-fabric/remote-backends.json`:

`RemoteBackend { service, site_id, route_domain, vip?, address, port, weight, state,
drain_until_unix_ms?, labels{}, updated_unix_ms }`.

- Sites publish/pull via Fabric REST (`/api/dataplane/remote-backends…`).
- `reconcile` merges same-domain **Ready** and active **Draining** remotes into
  existing FluxVM Maglev service upserts on owning-domain nodes (local backends
  preserved; colliding `(address, port)` never clobbers local). Unhealthy remotes
  are skipped. Expired drains (`now > drain_until_unix_ms`) are skipped when
  reconcile passes a non-zero clock.
- **Weighted drain handoff** — `POST …/drain` sets `state=Draining`, optional lower
  Maglev `weight`, and `drain_until_unix_ms` (default now+5m), then reconciles.
- **Multi-VIP** — optional `vip` matches Maglev specs by VIP (one Maglev service
  name per VIP; remotes carry matching `vip` for safety). Without `vip`, match by
  service name (back-compat). Reconcile lists node services to discover VIP targets.
- Cross-domain remotes are ignored (same fencing as identities).
- Delete removes all VIP catalog rows for `(route_domain, service, address, port)`
  and re-reconciles so the backend drops from the next Maglev upsert.
- **Tunnels still N/A** — datapath is L3/anycast VIP + remote endpoint merge, not
  Geneve/VXLAN overlays. Lifecycle v2 (weighted drain + multi-VIP) is shipped;
  Geneve/VXLAN remain out of scope.

## Remaining candidates

1. Stricter multi-queue RSS affinity proofs (pin flows, assert queue mapping) — under-load PPS + best-effort multi-queue RX shipped.

Lab Mpps/CPU ceilings: FluxVM `SLO_LAB=1` / `scripts/test-service-fabric-lab.sh`
(`SLO_MPPS_MIN=0.05`, `SLO_PKT_MPPS_MIN=0.10`, `SLO_CPU_MAX_PERCENT=85`).

Ownership remains unchanged: FluxVM owns local packet/runtime mechanics; Fabric owns distributed leases, routing, discovery, multi-site policy/HA, remote identity directory, and remote backend mesh.
