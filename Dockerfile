# Builds zyvor-fabricd + zyvorctl (Rust) and the web console (Node), then
# assembles a single runtime image. See docs/DOCKER.md for how to run it
# with Docker or Podman, and why it needs network_mode: host + the specific
# capability list in docker-compose.yml (this Dockerfile only builds the
# image; it doesn't grant any of that).

#   creation goes through rtnetlink directly, but `ip tuntap add` for TAP
#   devices and `nft` for every policy subsystem are still real subprocess
