// A proactive suggestion finder — the "keeps working after you close the app" piece of a personal agent, built the way Keep does
// everything else: heuristic, bounded, and only ever a *suggestion* (docs/keep/suggestions/README.md). No model, no learned behaviour,
// no network beyond the one read. Meant to run on a schedule (`POST /v1/schedules`, e.g. once a day), the same as any other
// `suggestions: true` agent; a person still decides whether to accept each one, and accepting only makes an ordinary goal.
//
// Two plain rules, both derived from a single calendar read:
//   - an event coming up with no notes attached gets a "prepare for it" suggestion;
//   - an event with other people invited but nowhere to meet (no location, no video link) gets a "add a place" suggestion.
