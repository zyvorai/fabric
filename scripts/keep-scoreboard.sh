# Keep scoreboard gate. No KVM required.
#
# This is a wiring/self-consistency check, not a live measurement of a real runtime: it writes a
# policy, packs it, unpacks it onto a second directory, and hashes it, then writes a scoreboard
# JSON that asserts on values (including the two model sockets) that this same script just wrote.
# It proves the receipt shape and the pack-round-trip mechanics agree with agent-runtime/src/
# scoreboard.rs's validation rules; it does not exercise the real egress broker, a real deployed
# agent's actual model socket configuration, or a real cell. See docs/keep/AHEAD.md.
