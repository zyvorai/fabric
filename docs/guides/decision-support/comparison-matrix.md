## Architecture Comparison

| Aspect | Zyvor Fabric | libvirt/virsh | Proxmox VE |
|--------|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Hypervisor** | QEMU/KVM via systemd-vmspawn | QEMU/KVM (+ Xen, LXC) | QEMU/KVM + LXC |
| **Management layer** | systemd-machined + REST API | libvirtd daemon + XML API | pvemanager + Perl API |
| **Configuration format** | JSON (REST API) | XML domain definitions | Perl config files + web UI |
| **Init system integration** | Native systemd (machined, networkd, journald) | Standalone (systemd unit for libvirtd only) | Standalone (custom init scripts) |
| **Language** | Rust (backend), React (frontend) | C (libvirt), various (bindings) | Perl (backend), JavaScript (frontend) |
| **Cluster support** | Single-host (multi-host networking available) | Single-host (requires external orchestration) | Built-in multi-node cluster |
| **License** | Open source | LGPL | AGPL (open source) + subscription |

### Key Architectural Differences

**Zyvor Fabric** delegates VM process management to `systemd-machined` and uses `systemd-vmspawn` for launching VMs. This means VMs are first-class systemd units -- visible in `machinectl list`, their logs appear in `journalctl`, and their resource controls use standard cgroup hierarchies. The Rust backend provides a REST API layer over these systemd primitives.

**libvirt** provides its own abstraction layer over hypervisors. It manages VM lifecycle through its own daemon (libvirtd) and stores configuration as XML. It does not integrate with systemd-machined; VMs are tracked internally by libvirt.

**Proxmox VE** is a full-stack solution that includes its own cluster filesystem (pmxcfs), authentication (PAM + PVE realm), and web UI. It uses qemu-server for VM management with its own configuration format.

## API and Automation

| Feature | Zyvor Fabric | libvirt/virsh | Proxmox VE |
|---------|---------|---------------|------------|
| **REST API** | 480+ endpoints, JSON | No native REST (XML-RPC) | REST API available |
| **API authentication** | JWT + PAM | SASL, polkit | Ticket-based + PAM |
| **CLI tool** | curl / any HTTP client | virsh | pvesh / pvecm |
| **Language bindings** | Any (HTTP/JSON) | C, Python, Go, Java, Perl | Perl, Python (community) |
| **WebSocket console** | Built-in (binary I/O) | Via VNC/SPICE protocols | noVNC via web UI |
| **Event streaming** | SSE (real-time) | Event loop (libvirt API) | Not available natively |
| **Infrastructure-as-code** | JSON API (Terraform-friendly) | XML templates | Terraform provider available |
| **Pagination** | Built-in (offset/limit) | Not available | Built-in |
| **Rate limiting** | Per-user + global | Not available | Not available |

### API Design Philosophy

Zyvor Fabric exposes every capability through a consistent REST API with JSON payloads. This makes it straightforward to integrate with CI/CD pipelines, custom scripts, and infrastructure-as-code tools without installing language-specific client libraries.

libvirt requires binding to its C library (or using language-specific wrappers) and working with XML documents. While powerful, this creates a higher integration barrier for teams not already familiar with libvirt.

Proxmox provides a REST API, but many advanced features are more easily accessed through the web UI or Perl CLI tools.
