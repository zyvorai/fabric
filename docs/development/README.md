## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ssahani/zyvor-fabric.git
cd zyvor-fabric

# Build all backend crates
cd backend && cargo build

# Run the test suite
cargo test

# Build the web UI
cd ../web && npm install && npm run build

# Run the daemon locally (needs root for KVM/network access)
sudo ./backend/target/debug/zyvor-fabricd
```

## Key Concepts

### AppState

All shared state is held in `AppState` (defined in `Zyvor Fabric/src/server.rs`),
which is wrapped in `Arc` and injected into every Axum handler via the `State`
extractor. Key fields include the state store, config, driver, all networking
subsystems, the event broadcast channel, and the shutdown cancellation token.

### Per-VM Locking

State-changing operations (start, stop, delete, etc.) acquire a per-VM mutex
from `AppState::vm_lock(name)`. This prevents race conditions when multiple
API calls target the same VM concurrently.

### Background Reconciliation

Many subsystems use background reconciler tasks that run on a periodic interval.
These tasks compare desired state (stored in the state store) with actual state
(queried from the kernel or systemd) and make corrections. All reconcilers are
launched via the `spawn_bg!` macro and participate in graceful shutdown.

### Driver Abstraction

`VmDriver` (an umbrella over `VMDriver`, `ResourceControlDriver`,
`ResourceStatsDriver`, `LogDriver`, `ImageDriver`, `ShellDriver`,
`ConsoleDriver`, and `CapabilityProvider`) in `driver-core` defines the
interface for VM lifecycle, cgroup resource control, log streaming, image
management, shell exec, and the interactive console. `FluxVmDriver` is
the only implementation — it talks to a separate
[FluxVM](https://github.com/zyvorai/fluxvm) process over its REST
API (`driver.fluxvm_url` in `zyvor-fabricd.toml`); no systemd
dependency at all.

This trait boundary is what makes testing with mock drivers possible.
It's also the reason the systemd-machined/systemd-vmspawn backend that
used to sit here (`MachinectlDriver`) could be deleted cleanly once
FluxVM covered every capability it provided.
