# Contributing to Zyvor Fabric

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Zyvor Fabric.

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zyvorai/fabric.git
cd zyvor-fabric
```

2. Build the backend:
```bash
cd backend
cargo build
```

3. Build the web UI:
```bash
cd web
npm install
```

## Project Structure

The backend is a Cargo workspace containing 53 crates. Key crates include `zyvor-fabricd` (the
main daemon), `zyvorctl` (CLI), and `crates/fluxvm-driver`
(the VM driver — [FluxVM](https://github.com/zyvorai/fluxvm), no systemd dependency).
`zyvor-fabric-vm-driver` builds VM images via `mkosi`, unrelated to VM lifecycle. Shared
libraries live under `backend/crates/` (storage, system, vm).

The web frontend is a React application located in the `web/` directory.

## Quick Validation

Before submitting changes, run these from the `backend/` directory:

```bash
# Fast compile check (no codegen, catches most errors quickly)
cargo check

# Full test suite
cargo test

# Lint checks
cargo clippy
cargo fmt --check
```

For web UI changes:

```bash
cd web
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Catch-up coverage (FluxVM boundary)

GitHub Actions job **Catch-up coverage** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) plus Fabric E2E
(`fabric-e2e.yml` → `tests/e2e-api-test.sh` sourcing `scripts/ci-feat-catchup-stub.sh`)
gates the FluxVM ↔ Fabric catch-up surface:

- Stub: `tests/fixtures/fluxvm-stub.py` (`/readyz.secure_containers`, dataplane
  `pod_ingress_*` / `pod_policy`, QGA, migration status)
- Rust contracts: `fluxvm-client` / `fluxvm-driver` / `migration` / `datacenter` /
  fabricd `agent_runtime` + container placement / heartbeat tests
- Web path contracts: `npx vitest run src/api/__tests__/api-files.test.ts -t "containerGroups|agents|dataplane catch-up"`
- Lab-only: `scripts/feat-catchup-verify.sh`

When changing those APIs, keep the stub and Vitest paths in sync.

## Code Style

- Rust: Follow `rustfmt` and `clippy` guidelines. Run `cargo fmt` before committing.
- TypeScript: Follow ESLint rules configured in the project.
- Commits: Use conventional commits format (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`).

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make your changes
4. Add or update tests as appropriate
5. Run `cargo check` and `cargo test` to verify nothing is broken
6. Submit a PR with a clear description of what changed and why
