# Notifications

## Purpose

Notifications — configure how and when Zyvor Fabric alerts you: the delivery channels (email, Slack, Teams, webhook), the rules that trigger them, and a history of what was actually sent.

## When to use it

- Setting up a Slack, Teams, email, or webhook channel to receive alerts
- Checking whether a rule has fired, how often, and whether delivery succeeded or failed
- Testing a channel to confirm it's wired up correctly before relying on it
- Temporarily disabling a rule or channel without deleting its configuration

## How to get there

- Route / id: `/notifications`
- Nav: **Monitoring → Notifications** (sidebar, command palette, or desktop nav)

## What you can do

The page has three tabs — **Channels**, **Rules**, **History** — loaded together on open.

**Channels** (default tab)
- **Add Channel** opens a form: name, type (Webhook, Slack, Teams, Email), and type-specific fields — a URL for Webhook/Slack/Teams, or SMTP host/port + from/to address for Email.
- **Test** sends a real test notification through that channel (disabled if the channel isn't enabled).
- **Delete** removes a channel after a confirmation prompt.

**Rules**
- Each rule shows enabled/disabled state, its description, up to 3 event-type tags (with a "+N more" overflow), how many times it has triggered, and when it last fired.
- The enable/disable toggle (power icon) flips a rule on or off immediately.
- **Delete** removes a rule after a confirmation prompt.
- **Create Rule** opens a form: name, description, VM event types (created, started, stopped, snapshot taken, hotplug, error, etc.), severity levels, and which channels to notify. Every enabled rule is evaluated in real time against actual VM events — a matching rule sends through each selected channel and updates its trigger count and last-fired time here.

**History**
- A table of everything that's actually been sent: timestamp, rule name, event type (severity-colored), affected VM (if any), channel, and delivery status (`SENT`/`FAILED`).

If the channels list fails to load, an error banner with retry appears; rules and history failing to load independently just show as empty rather than blocking the page.

If the page stays empty, check service health, auth configuration, and that dependencies for this domain are installed.
