//! `driver-core` implementation backed by [FluxVM](https://github.com/zyvorai/fluxvm)
//! — the only `VmDriver` implementation left as of the systemd-removal
//! migration's final phase; the systemd-machined/systemd-vmspawn backend
//! this replaced (`machinectl-driver`/`machined-dbus`) is gone. `VMDriver`'s
//! create/stop/pause/resume/list/state/properties/leader-pid map directly
//! onto FluxVM's REST API. `ResourceControlDriver`/`ResourceStatsDriver`
//! are backed by FluxVM's cgroup-delegation extension (see
//! `resource_control.rs`). `LogDriver` streams real captured console output
//! over FluxVM's `GET /v1/vms/{id}/logs` (see `resource_control.rs`'s
//! `stream_logs` impl); the one fidelity reduction versus the old
//! journald-backed driver is that raw serial console output has no
//! per-line priority/unit metadata, so every entry is stamped uniformly.
//! `ConsoleDriver` (see `console.rs`) gives an interactive shell over
//! FluxVM's console WebSocket, itself backed by the vsock guest agent's
//! `OpenShell` op.
//!
//! **Known gap as of FluxVM v0.1.0**: `fluxvm-client`'s wire types are a
//! hand-synced mirror of `fluxvm-core::model` (see that crate's own doc
//! comment for why), and haven't yet picked up several fields/capabilities
//! FluxVM has since grown — `CreateVmRequest.storage` (LVM thin/NBD/Ceph
//! RBD backends) and `VmRecord`'s `jail_path`/`vsock_socket`/`lvm_lv`/
//! `nbd_pid` fields. Bridged VMs already use `NetworkSpec::Tap { netns:
//! true }`, and Network Fabric v3 (`VmDataplaneDriver`) proxies FluxVM's
//! `/v1/vms/{id}/network/*` when FluxVM runs with
//! `[sandbox.dataplane] mode = "ebpf"`. Also orthogonal to this driver:
//! FluxVM's `fluxvm-kube` Kubernetes CRD/operator and `fluxvm-agent`
//! distributed fleet registry.
