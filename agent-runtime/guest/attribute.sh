# The lookup reads /proc as root: /proc/net/tcp{,6} for the socket inode, then the fd tables for
# the process that holds it, then /proc/<pid>/exe for the program and its hash. It sees processes
# in child PID namespaces (the inner container's). It trusts the guest kernel, so it stops an
# agent *process*, not a compromised guest.
